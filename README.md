RemTModPack-FTB
===============

A private custom modpack based on the ever popular Feed The Beast modpack.

Notable differences between the Feed The Beast modpack and this one:
- Equivalent Exchange and Minecraft Factory Reloaded have been removed
- Addition of Mo' Creatures! mod
- Compatibility with Aether 2 mod

How to install:
===============

1. Download the .zip of the modpack, which can be found on the right side of the Github website this modpack is available from.
2. Extract the contents of the .zip file to any location of your choice.
3. Launch the MultiMC application, then in the window that pops up, double-click on the RemTModPack-FTB-Aether2 instance.

Server Rules:
=============

1. NO GRIEFING OF ANY KIND (direct or indirect) is allowed on the server which will cause damage to another player's "property". This includes but is not limited to bases, items, owned mobs, etc.
2. While killing another player directly is not permitted, indirect death is permitted as long as it does not break the 1st rule. Indirect death means that your player name must not show up as having killed another player. You will be penalised if this rule is broken.
3. Any dropped items from players due to death indirectly caused by another player must be made available to the killed player whenever possible, otherwise it will be breaking the 1st rule.
4. The rules above can be ignored if 2 or more players agree to "battle it out". The winner is free to take any items a player drops when defeated. The "battle arena" must be agreed upon by all players involved.
5. Aiding of other players in any fashion is allowed.
6. A standard currency/economy system will be made available at a later date. Players are asked to follow the currency system once established to promote fair trade, but will not be enforced.

If any of the first 3 rules are broken with no clear reason as to why it was broken, the player who broke the rule(s) will be punished. The severity of the punishment will be decided by me, the server admin, while taking into account any opinions voiced by any other players involved.

Interested in Aether 2?

This will allow you to enjoy the added features Aether 2 provides, however it is HIGHLY ADVISED that you disable the Aether 2 mod if you wish to play on the server.
